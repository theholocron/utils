            Hey @${{ github.event.issue.user.login }}!
            We really appreciate you taking the time to report an issue. The
            collaborators on this project attempt to help as many people as
            possible, but we are a limited number of volunteers, so it is
            possible that this will not be addressed as swiftly.

            Your patience is much appreciated and we will get back to you as
            quickly as possible.
